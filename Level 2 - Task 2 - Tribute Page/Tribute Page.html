                        <h2>A brief summary of Charles Babbage's journey</h2>
                        <h3>Early life</h3>
                        <p>
                            Babbage's birthplace is disputed, but according to the Oxford Dictionaryof National Biography he was most likely born at 44 Crosby Row, Walworth Road, London, England.
                            A blue plaque on the junction of Larcom Street and Walworth Road commemorates the event.
                            His date of birth was given in his obituary in The Times as 26 December 1792; but then a nephew wrote to say that Babbage was born one year earlier, in 1791.
                            The parish register of St. Mary's, Newington, London, shows that Babbage was baptised on 6 January 1792, supporting a birth year of 1791.
                            Babbage was one of four children of Benjamin Babbage and Betsy Plumleigh Teape.
                            His father was a banking partner of William Praed in founding Praed's & Co. of Fleet Street, London, in 1801.
                            In 1808, the Babbage family moved into the old Rowdens house in East Teignmouth.
                            Around the age of eight, Babbage was sent to a country school in Alphington near Exeter to recover from a life-threatening fever.
                            For a short time, he attended King Edward VI Grammar School in Totnes, South Devon, but his health forced him back to private tutors for a time.
                            Babbage then joined the 30-student Holmwood Academy, in Baker Street, Enfield, Middlesex, under the Reverend Stephen Freeman.
                            The academy had a library that prompted Babbage's love of mathematics.
                            He studied with two more private tutors after leaving the academy.
                            The first was a clergyman near Cambridge; through him Babbage encountered Charles Simeon and his evangelical followers, but the tuition was not what he needed.
                            He was brought home, to study at the Totnes school: this was at age 16 or 17.
                            The second was an Oxford tutor, under whom Babbage reached a level in Classics sufficient to be accepted by the University of Cambridge.
                        </p>
                        <h3>At the Cambridge</h3>
                        <p>
                            Babbage arrived at Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1810.
                            He was already self-taught in some parts of contemporary mathematics;he had read Robert Woodhouse, Joseph Louis Lagrange, and Marie Agnesi.
                            As a result, he was disappointed in the standard mathematical instruction available at the university.
                            Babbage, John Herschel, George Peacock, and several other friends formed the Analytical Society in 1812; they were also close to Edward Ryan.
                            As a student, Babbage was also a member of other societies such as The Ghost Club, concerned with investigating supernatural phenomena, and the Extractors Club, dedicated to liberating its members from the madhouse, should any be committed to one.
                            In 1812, Babbage transferred to Peterhouse, Cambridge.
                            He was the top mathematician there, but did not graduate with honours.
                            He instead received a degree without examination in 1814.
                            He had defended a thesis that was considered blasphemous in the preliminary public disputation, but it is not known whether this fact is related to his not sitting the examination.
                        </p>
                        <h3>After Cambridge</h3>
                        <p>
                            Considering his reputation, Babbage quickly made progress.
                            He lectured to the Royal Institution on astronomy in 1815, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1816.
                            After graduation, on the other hand, he applied for positions unsuccessfully, and had little in the way of a career.
                            In 1816 he was a candidate for a teaching job at Haileybury College; he had recommendations from James Ivory and John Playfair, but lost out to Henry Walter.
                            In 1819, Babbage and Herschel visited Paris and the Society of Arcueil, meeting leading French mathematicians and physicists.
                            That year Babbage applied to be professor at the University of Edinburgh, with the recommendation of Pierre Simon Laplace; the post went to William Wallace.
                            With Herschel, Babbage worked on the electrodynamics of Arago's rotations, publishing in 1825.
                            Their explanations were only transitional, being picked up and broadened by Michael Faraday.
                            The phenomena are now part of the theory of eddy currents, and Babbage and Herschel missed some of the clues to unification of electromagnetic theory, staying close to Ampère's force law.
                            Babbage purchased the actuarial tables of George Barrett, who died in 1821 leaving unpublished work, and surveyed the field in 1826 in Comparative View of the Various Institutions for the Assurance of Lives.
                            This interest followed a project to set up an insurance company, prompted by Francis Baily and mooted in 1824, but not carried out.
                            Babbage did calculate actuarial tables for that scheme, using Equitable Society mortality data from 1762 onwards.
                            During this whole period, Babbage depended awkwardly on his father's support, given his father's attitude to his early marriage, of 1814: he and Edward Ryan wedded the Whitmore sisters.
                            He made a home in Marylebone in London and established a large family.
                            On his father's death in 1827, Babbage inherited a large estate (value around £100,000, equivalent to £9.21 million or $12.6 million today), making him independently wealthy.
                            After his wife's death in the same year he spent time travelling.
                            In Italy he met Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, foreshadowing a later visit to Piedmont.
                            In April 1828 he was in Rome, and relying on Herschel to manage the difference engine project, when he heard that he had become a professor at Cambridge, a position he had three times failed to obtain (in 1820, 1823 and 1826).   
                        </p>
                        <h3>Later Life</h3>
                        <p>
                            The British Association was consciously modelled on the Deutsche Naturforscher-Versammlung, founded in 1822.
                            It rejected romantic science as well as metaphysics, and started to entrench the divisions of science from literature, and professionals from amateurs.
                            Belonging as he did to the "Wattite" faction in the BAAS, represented in particular by James Watt the younger, Babbage identified closely with industrialists.
                            He wanted to go faster in the same directions, and had little time for the more gentlemanly component of its membership.
                            Indeed, he subscribed to a version of conjectural history that placed industrial society as the culmination of human development (and shared this view with Herschel).
                            A clash with Roderick Murchison led in 1838 to his withdrawal from further involvement.
                            At the end of the same year he sent in his resignation as Lucasian professor, walking away also from the Cambridge struggle with Whewell.
                            His interests became more focussed, on computation and metrology, and on international contacts.

                        <h3>Computing Pioneer</h3>
                        <p>
                            Babbage's machines were among the first mechanical computers.
                            That they were not actually completed was largely because of funding problems and clashes of personality, most notably with George Biddell Airy, the Astronomer Royal.
                            Babbage directed the building of some steam-powered machines that achieved some modest success, suggesting that calculations could be mechanised.
                            For more than ten years he received government funding for his project, which amounted to £17,000, but eventually the Treasury lost confidence in him.
                            While Babbage's machines were mechanical and unwieldy, their basic architecture was similar to that of a modern computer.
                            The data and program memory were separated, operation was instruction-based, the control unit could make conditional jumps, and the machine had a separate I/O unit.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Death</h3>
                        <p>
                            Babbage lived and worked for over 40 years at 1 Dorset Street, Marylebone, where he died, at the age of 79, on 18 October 1871; he was buried in London's Kensal Green Cemetery. According to Horsley, Babbage died "of renal inadequacy, secondary to cystitis."
                            He had declined both a knighthood[failed verification] and baronetcy. He also argued against hereditary peerages, favouring life peerages instead.
